# Inter Profile Sharing Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 30. October 2024

## Introduction

*Ventral Digital LLC* ("we", "us", "our") develops and maintains the *Inter Profile Sharing* mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our App and the choices you have associated with that data.

## Information We Collect

We do not collect any personal information or usage data through the App.

## Third-Party Services

While our App does not collect data, please be aware that platforms providing the App for download (such as Google Play Store, GitHub) may collect data during the browsing and installation process. Refer to their respective privacy policies for more information. Once installed, our App does not use an internet connection to send data anywhere. It does not contain any third-party tracking software or make use of any advertising providers.

## Use of Data

Since we do not collect any personal data, we do not use your personal information in any way. Since we do not collect any personal data, many aspects of data protection regulations like GDPR and CCPA may not apply. However, we are committed to respecting user privacy and maintaining transparency about our data practices.

## Disclosure of Data

We do not disclose any personal data to third parties on request because we do not collect any.

Please note that sharing data locally is a primary function of our App. When you share items such as files, links, text, or clipboard contents, these items may become accessible to other applications or parts of the operating system on your device. We are not responsible for any unauthorized access or disclosure of data that occurs through other applications, the operating system, or due to malicious software on your device. We encourage you to use the encryption feature within our App to enhance the security of your shared data.

## Security of Data

While our App does not collect personal data, we prioritize the security and integrity of the App to protect our users from unauthorized access, alteration, or misuse. We implement standard security practices to ensure the App functions safely on your device. These measures include 2 Factor Authentication on platforms where the source code and application binaries are hosted, avoiding the inclusion of experimental and unmaintained 3rd party libraries, the use of isolated development environments, the requirement of thorough code review before the addition or changes of the source code from 3rd party contributors.

## Children's Privacy

Our App does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us, and we will take steps to remove that information.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect or process your personal data, you retain all rights to your personal information when using our App.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy at any time to correct any grammar or wording issues. But we won't start collecting data with this App at any point in the future. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.
